# KillSwitch firmware source files

This is the source code for the firmware that resides on the KillSwitch device. It is currently written specifically for the Arduino Uno, as that is my primary testbed, although it should run or could be adapted to almost any Atmel AVR that Arduino supports.

It may also get rewritten in C to support microcontrollers not supported by Arduino, as well as saving space to make it work on smaller microcontrollers.
