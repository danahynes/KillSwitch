# KillSwitch hardware files for Pi3

KiCad files for KillSwitch printed circuit board

These are the files used to make the printed circuit board for the KillSwitch device. They are arranged as a KiCad 5.0 project and include custom libraries for both the sheet block logo and the silkscreen logo.

This PCB is for the Pi 2/3 (specifically the Pi 3 B+, although it should work on any Pi 2 or Pi 3 as well).
