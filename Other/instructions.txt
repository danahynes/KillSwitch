if we add a new setting:

add necessary EEPROM constants
add default value to firmware EEPROM in setup() if not 0
add serial code to firmware to read/write new setting in loop()
add code to software settings init to see if new setting has a value
if it's blank, write the default to the conf file

to create new release of master:

update number in Other/make-release.py
save
run Other/make-release.py

open/close killswitch-firmware_X.X.X.hex to stage it

commit/push

log into github
go to repo
click on releases above color bar
click draft new release
tag version should be vX.X.X
branch is master
write title as vX.X.X
write description
publish release

clone github repo on pi:

cd ~/Downloads; rm -rf KillSwitch; git clone https://github.com/danahynes/KillSwitch.git; cd KillSwitch/Software/Bash; sudo ./killswitch-install.sh

one-liner:

cd && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danahynes/KillSwitch/master/killswitch-install-latest.sh && bash killswitch-install-latest.sh

reboot-test and shutdown-test use wiringPi gpio, not installed on RetroPie:
cd
git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
cd wiringPi
./build

loopback serial for testing:

./home/dana/Documents/Bash/terminaloop/terminaloop
OR
socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0

Arduino on laptop will be /dev/ttyAMX
close cutecom between programming
