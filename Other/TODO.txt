States.ods - need to know initial state of gpio's on Pi and arduino
    this will also determine if/where pullups or pulldowns are needed
Arduino trigger pin starts as input but floating
pi trigger pin starts as input floating or output high depending on tech source
    this should be fine as the arduino will have settled into output mode and
    the pi will become input and read arduino output when the script starts
arduino feedback pin starts as input but floating
pi feedback pin starts as input floating or output high depending on tech source
    this should be fine as the arduino will have settled into input pullup mode
    and is waiting for the pi to send a low at bootup

when the pi is done shutting down, what is the state of the feedback pin?
    the arduino has a pullup, but the pi may latch the pin to a low state

kicad custom logo for sheet/silkscreen need to be included
also default sheet? for logo in block

use pulses for trigger in killswitch-boot.py? (instead of timing length of pulse)

install/uninstall should check each command to see if it failed
if anything fails, bail

documentation on how the button/programming/led works
documentation on how to use settings

make work with toggle (but let ppl know they can't futz with the switch during
    bootup/shutdown)

convert install to py (what if user doesn't have py?)
convert settings to py
convert uninstall to py
