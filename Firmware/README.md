# KillSwitch firmware files

These are the source code and binary files for the firmware that resides on the
KillSwitch device. It is currently written specifically for the Arduino Uno,
although it could be adapted to almost any Atmel AVR that Arduino supports, and
the hardware may change in the future.

The killswitch-firmware_x.x_xx.xx.xx.hex file is the compiled binary that is
flashed onto the device.
